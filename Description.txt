Two datasets provided:
vehicles - table of all vehicles and their attributes:
• technology: 0 if none, 1 if yes (technology that is installed in vehicles that makes them "instantly
bookable" and unlockable with mobile phone)
• actual_price: actual daily price for vehicle (owners are able to set whatever price they want)
• recommended_price: appropriate "market" price for the vehicle, based on our analysis
• num_images: number of photos of the car
• street_parking: 0 no, 1 yes
• description: number of characters of the car description inputted by the owner
reservations - table of all completed reservations:
• vehicle_id: vehicle's unique ID
• reservation_type: 1 is Hourly rental, 2 is Daily, 3 is Weekly

Analysis on:
• Which of the factors seem to be most important in driving total # of reservations for our vehicles?
(technology type, pricing, number of car photos, street parking, car description length)
• How does the car's technology type seem to affect reservations?
